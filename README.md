📘 Java Data Structures

A custom implementation of fundamental data structures built from scratch to deeply understand internal mechanics of the Java Collections Framework.

This project focuses on:

Internal resizing strategies

Iterators & fail-fast behavior

Time & space complexity analysis

Clean API design

Generics and type safety

🚀 Implemented Data Structures
✅ Linear Structures

 MyArrayList (Dynamic Array)

 MyLinkedList (Singly / Doubly)

 MyStack

 MyQueue

 MyDeque

✅ Hash-Based Structures

 MyHashMap

 MyHashSet

✅ Caching Structures

 LRU Cache

 LFU Cache

✅ Tree Structures

 Binary Search Tree

 AVL Tree

 Trie

🧠 Key Features

Generic implementations (<T>, <K, V>)

Dynamic resizing (amortized O(1))

Fail-fast iterators

Load factor & rehashing (planned)

Clean separation of responsibilities

Edge case handling

📊 Complexity Summary
Structure	Access	Insert	Delete
ArrayList	O(1)	O(n)	O(n)
LinkedList	O(n)	O(1)*	O(1)*
HashMap	O(1)*	O(1)*	O(1)*

* Average case

📚 Why This Project?

To deeply understand how Java’s Collection Framework works internally instead of treating it as a black box.
